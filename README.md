# 📚 Bookify

**Bookify** is a simple full-stack web application that allows users to borrow, return, and pay for books. It is built with **React** (frontend) and **Java Spring Boot** (backend).

## 🚀 Deployment

- **Frontend**: Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- **Backend**: Deployed on [Railway](https://railway.app/)
- **Authentication**: Integrated with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) for login/logout
- **Payment**: Integrated with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) in test mode with full features

## 🧱 Technologies Used

### Frontend – React
- React 18
- React Router DOM
- Auth0 React SDK (`@auth0/auth0-react`) – for authentication
- Stripe JS + React Stripe (`@stripe/react-stripe-js`, `@stripe/stripe-js`) – for payment
- TypeScript
- Hosting: Vercel

### Backend – Spring Boot
- Spring Boot 3.2
- Maven
- Java 18
- RESTful API
- Hosting: Railway

## 🔐 Authentication – Auth0

Auth0 is used for OAuth2/OIDC user authentication. After logging in, users are redirected to `/callback` and issued an access token to communicate securely with the backend API.

## 💳 Payment – Stripe

Stripe is integrated to handle secure payments using the `@stripe/react-stripe-js` package on the frontend and `stripe` SDK on the backend to create checkout sessions.
